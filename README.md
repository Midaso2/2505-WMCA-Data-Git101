Project Example Idea 1: Retail Sales Data Analysis
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset 
Data analysis goals: Analyse retail sales data to identify trends, insights, and the impact of promotional markdowns on sales. Provide comprehensive, visually appealing sales reports and insights to assist in strategic decision-making.

Context

The challenge involves making decisions based on limited historical data, particularly around holidays and promotional events. The dataset includes historical sales data for 45 stores in different regions, with details about store types, sizes, and promotional markdowns.

Potential features to include:
ETL Pipeline:
Extract: Load data from the Excel sheets (Stores, Features, Sales).
Transform: Clean the data, handle missing values, and create new features such as sales differences between holiday and non-holiday weeks.
Load: Store the transformed data in a format suitable for analysis (e.g., a cleaned DataFrame).
Data Visualisation:
Descriptive Statistics: Display basic statistics such as average sales per store and department.
Trend Analysis: Plot sales trends over time for different stores and departments.
Impact Analysis: Visualise the impact of markdowns on sales during holidays versus non-holiday periods.
Comparative Analysis: Compare sales performance across different stores and regions.
